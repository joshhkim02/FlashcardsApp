# FlashcardsApp
A console application working with SQLite allowing users to create stacks of flashcards to study any topic they desire. 

## Project information:
The program allows users to create, edit, and delete stacks of flashcards. Within these stacks, they can also create, view, and delete these cards. Database tables (Stack and Flashcard) are linked with a one to many relationship, where if a stack is deleted, any corresponding flashcards in that stack are deleted as well.
